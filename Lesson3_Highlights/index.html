            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this book you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer. Version Control systems allow multiple users to make changes in real time. At the simplest level, developers could simply retain multiple copies of the different versions of the program, and label them appropriately. This simple approach has been used on many large software projects.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Sometimes it is hard to remember what a repository is but there are strictly only two types of repositories: local and remote. The local repository refers to a copy on your own installation that is a cache of the remote downloads, and also contains the temporary build artifacts that you have not yet released. In general, you should not need to do anything with the local repository on a regular basis, except clean it out if you are short on disk space (or erase it completely if you are willing to download everything again). Scroll down to learn about remote repositories.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Remote repositories refer to any other type of repository, accessed by a variety of protocols. These repositories might be a truly remote repository set up by a third party to provide their artifacts for Other "remote" repositories may be internal repositories set up on a file or HTTP server within your company, used to share private artifacts between development teams and for releases. The local and remote repositories are structured the same way so that scripts can easily be run on either side, or they can be synced for offline used. Repositories are a wonderful tool for people to use. Scroll down to learn more about a VSC system that is both a local and remote repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">According to the Git website, it thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesnâ€™t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.  Scroll down to learn more about Git commands.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Here are a few git commands (and what they mean/do) that can help get any user started! 1: git config --global user.name "Sam Smith" (Configure the author name and email address to be used with your commits.) 2: git config --global user.email sam@example.com (Note that Git strips some characters (for example trailing periods) 3: from user.name.) git init (Create a working copy of a local repository) 4: git clone /path/to/repository (For a remote server, use) 5: git clone username@host:/path/to/repository (Add one or more files to staging (index)) 6: git add < filename> (Commit changes to head (but not yet to the remote repository) 7: git add * (Commit any files you've added with git add, and also commit any files you've changed since then) 8: git commit -m "Commit message" (Send changes to the master branch of your remote repository). This may seem crazy or disfunctioal but with these commands and a few others you'll be on your way using git. </p>
